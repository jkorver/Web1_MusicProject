	        <p>OMG!!! I have always LOVED Billy Joel, but seeing him LIVE was the Best Concert I've ever experienced!!!</p>
	        <p>Mind you I was born in the 70s. I grew up listening to him because my mom has his collection from 8 tracks to cassettes.</p>
	        <p>I just can't explain how AMAZING he sounds in person as he sang his hit songs!!  My hubby hit it out of the ballpark for me by taking me to see Billy!</p>

	        <p>Billy Joel will set a Record-Breaking 50th consecutive MSG Show March 28, 2018. When he first set up shop in MSG, my wife said we should go! I said, lets wait until the masses see his show and when the tickets are more available. No such luck, Billy Joel has been selling out tickets to every single show. I figured, let me bite the bullet and score tickets for my wife's birthday and we'll make a weekend out of it.</p>
	        <p>Over the years, I've seen him play in Jones Beach as well as Foxwood casino. Nothing, NOTHING can compare to the show at MSG. Why? Because those other venues don't have the theatrics of Madison Square Garden. MSG is large and in charge, the venue was made for Billy Joel.</p>

	        <p>When you can see an artist that plays music from his entire career of over 40 years and have all ages dance and sing along - you're doing it right...and let me tell you - Billy Joel is doing it right!!</p>
	        <p>Great show, great set, great band, great audience...you get the point.</p>
	        <p>Another cool thing Billy Joel does is give the audience what he calls a "fielders choice". He'll pick 2 songs off of a particular album and give the crowd the chance to pick which they'll play next. It keeps the crowd engaged and shows what a talented band is backing him, too. Speaking of that - his backing band is pretty awesome!</p>

	        <p>What can one say that could possibly be sufficient to describe the experience of Billy Joel on concert, particularly at MSG?  If you haven't seen Billy here, you are missing out. This concert is different than his others because he isn't tied to any particular album; he plays many things from all of his albums, which means songs you may never have heard in concert. Billy offers the audience a chance to choose between options on several occasions. Billy Joel is the consummate entertainer. He's a legend.</p>

	        <p>Honestly one of the best concerts I have ever attended if not the best. Amazing how Billy Joel had both young and old dancing and singing along to all of his classics. Husband surprised me with great tickets and we had a great time. Billy performed for about 2 and half hours. His witty remarks and insights on how he came up with his hits were a highlight. Billy introduced his whole band and even had them perform some solo time. His roadie performing "highway to hell" was awesome. If you are on the fence just go. It was always on my bucket list to see Billy Joel in concert I’m grateful my hubby made it happen.</p>

	        <p>When you go see a show like this you are experiencing and being a part of history.  Our show was Billy's record breaking show for sold out performances at MSG for a solo artist.  Watching Billy at MSG is like watching all of the NYC local sports teams playing each other at home.  It was just a relaxing rocking experience.  Billy is at home and is loving every minute of it.  He still has his chops and looks like he can go another 20 years!</p>
	        <p>The benefit of not having any new material in 20+ years is that everyone at the show knows all of his material and can and will sing for him.  We did a lot of his work for him and loved every minute of it.</p>
	        <p>Feel blessed if you can experience this show!</p>
