        <p>OMG!!! I have always LOVED Billy Joel, but seeing him LIVE was the Best Concert I've ever experienced!!!</p>
        <p>Mind you I was born in the 70s. I grew up listening to him because my mom has his collection from 8 tracks to cassettes.</p>
        <p>I just can't explain how AMAZING he sounds in person as he sang his hit songs!!  My hubby hit it out of the ballpark for me by taking me to see Billy!</p>

        <p>Billy Joel will set a Record-Breaking 50th consecutive MSG Show March 28, 2018. When he first set up shop in MSG, my wife said we should go! I said, lets wait until the masses see his show and when the tickets are more available. No such luck, Billy Joel has been selling out tickets to every single show. I figured, let me bite the bullet and score tickets for my wife's birthday and we'll make a weekend out of it.</p>
        <p>Over the years, I've seen him play in Jones Beach as well as Foxwood casino. Nothing, NOTHING can compare to the show at MSG. Why? Because those other venues don't have the theatrics of Madison Square Garden. MSG is large and in charge, the venue was made for Billy Joel.</p>

        <p>When you can see an artist that plays music from his entire career of over 40 years and have all ages dance and sing along - you're doing it right...and let me tell you - Billy Joel is doing it right!!</p>
        <p>Great show, great set, great band, great audience...you get the point.</p>
        <p>Another cool thing Billy Joel does is give the audience what he calls a "fielders choice." He'll pick 2 songs off of a particular album and give the crowd the chance to pick which they'll play next. It keeps the crowd engaged and shows what a talented band is backing him, too. Speaking of that - his backing band is pretty awesome!</p>
